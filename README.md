# Thunderbird List Unsubscription Add-On
### Provided by Inxmail GmbH

## About the Add-On
Unsubscribe links are currently positioned at very different places within the newsletters. You no longer have to spend time searching for these links; instead, use the quick and easy unsubscribe function for Thunderbird, an add-on developed by Inxmail. You can now cancel your newsletter subscriptions in the user interface directly, as long as the newsletter mailer supports this function. <br />
<br />
The add-on developed by the email marketing provider is based on the “List-Unsubscribe” email header that is already being implemented by Google Mail and Windows Live Hotmail to offer this kind of user-friendly unsubscribe procedure to their customers. <br />
<br />
<br />
The email marketing expert supports a centralised unsubscribe function which allows recipients to cancel their subscriptions in the user interface of the email program - without having to search for the unsubscribe link within the newsletter.<br />
<br />
In addition to supporting this centralised unsubscribe procedure in the webmail programs Windows Live Hotmail and Google Mail, Inxmail has gone one step further. The "Unsubscribe from mailing lists" add-on also makes fair email marketing available for the email client Mozilla Thunderbird. <br />
<br />
As requirement for this add-on the newsletter mailer must be support this function by adding the following header to their mail: List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:address@yourdomain.com?subject=xxxx>.<br />
